\chapter*{Abstract}
Since the discovery of the Higgs boson at the LHC, attention has turned to testing its properties and searching for extended Higgs sectors that could reveal new physics. This thesis addresses three complementary topics within the CMS experiment: the study of a compact data format to meet the ever-growing computing needs, a direct search for additional Higgs bosons in the four-tau final state, and a precision measurement of the CP structure of the Higgs–tau Yukawa coupling. First, the development of the compact RAW' data format is described, demonstrating recovered performance in displaced track reconstruction and positioning RAW' as a promising option. Second, a search for additional Higgs bosons in the four-tau final state is performed using the full Run 2 dataset of $137\unit{fb}^{-1}$ at $\sqrt{s}=13\TeV$. No excess is observed, and exclusion limits on $Z^* \to \phi A \to 4\tau$ production reach from $\mathcal{O}(190\unit{fb})$ at low masses to $\mathcal{O}(0.4\unit{fb})$ at high masses. Regions of the Type-X 2HDM relevant to the muon anomalous magnetic moment are also excluded. Finally, a measurement of the CP structure of the Higgs–tau Yukawa coupling is performed in the $\tauh\tauh$ channel with Run 3 data, excluding the pure CP-odd hypothesis at $1.74\sigma$. When combined with the Run 2 result, the exclusion improves to $3.55\sigma$ with $\alpha^{\PH\tau\tau}$ constrained to $\pm 15^\circ$, representing the most precise determination to date. This result remains compatible with the SM prediction of a CP-even coupling.

\chapter*{Statement of Originality}

I declare that the work presented in this thesis is my own. Wherever figures, tables, or results have been taken from other sources, this is clearly indicated by a reference in the text or figure caption. Figures labelled ``CMS'' are sourced from CMS publications. The ``CMS preliminary'' label is attached to CMS public results that are not yet finalised by the Collaboration or the journal. The ``Simulation'' tag is used when only simulated data is shown in a CMS public plot. Figures labelled as ``Private work (CMS data/simulation)'' or ``Private work (CMS simulation)'' indicate non-public material; in the context of this thesis, these correspond to results currently under review by the CMS Collaboration. 

Chapters~1-4 do not contain original research by myself; rather, they provide essential background, covering the theoretical motivations, experimental apparatus, and methods used to produce and collect the data analysed in this thesis.  

The work in Chapter~5 forms part of my CMS ``service work'' and was carried out with the guidance of Dr.~Marco Musich. While the initial development was collaborative, the second iteration of the redefined data format presented in this chapter was conducted by myself.  

Chapter~6 describes a search for extended Higgs sector signatures, conducted in collaboration with members of the Imperial College London $H\to\tau\tau$ group, namely Dr~George Uttley and Dr~Daniel Winterbottom, under the supervision of Prof.~David Colling. I contributed across the full analysis workflow, from the implementation of the framework to the interpretation of the final results. My specific focus was on background modelling, optimisation strategies, uncertainty estimation, and the statistical interpretation of the results.  

The final analysis chapter presents a measurement of the CP structure of the Higgs-tau Yukawa coupling in $H\to\tau_h\tau_h$ decays, carried out in collaboration with other members of the CMS $H\to\tau\tau$ group. This particular channel was primarily developed by the Imperial College team consisting of Lucas Russell, Dr.~Daniel Winterbottom, and myself, under the supervision of Prof. David Colling. I contributed to all stages of the analysis workflow, with particular responsibility for setting up the framework, generating signal simulations, and optimising analysis cuts and techniques (including the development of the improved $X$-$a_1$ method, which was my own work). In addition, I contributed to the background modelling and the statistical interpretation of the results.

\chapter*{Acknowledgements}

First and foremost, I would like to thank Imperial College London for giving me the opportunity to pursue this PhD. I am especially grateful to Gavin Davies, Alex Tapper, and David Colling for allowing me to be part of the CMS collaboration. This has given me the chance to travel to amazing places such as St. Malo and Rome, to teach at CERN, and to attend conferences where I could learn from and engage with the wider physics community. These opportunities have shaped not only my research but also my growth as a scientist.  

I owe my deepest gratitude to my supervisor, Prof.~David Colling, for his guidance, understanding, and unwavering support throughout my PhD. Thank you for always being there for me. I would also like to thank the amazing team at Imperial. George Uttley was an incredible mentor in the early years of my PhD, and what he gave me I aspired to give to the next PhD students, Irene Andreou and Lucas Russell (I hope I did a decent job; if not, at least I tried!). I would also like to thank my postdoc, Daniel Winterbottom, for providing me with countless opportunities within CMS, and for always being there to help me through the technical challenges of day-to-day work. In the later stages of the $H \to \tau\tau$ CP analysis, both Lucas and Daniel offered tremendous help, and their contributions were crucial in tying together years of hard work.  

I would also like to thank all the groups involved in the CP analysis, with special thanks to Aliaksei for his incredible support and technical insights. Bouncing ideas back and forth with you has been one of the highlights of my PhD journey. I am also grateful to Marco Musich, whose technical help during my ``service work'' was invaluable and deeply appreciated.  

Of course, the support system throughout this PhD has been massive, and I still haven’t mentioned half the people! When I started, I thought I would gain knowledge and technical skills, but I also ended up gaining a whole new family. My cohort has grown into close friends: Alie, Teddy, David, James, Naseem, Kai, Maria, Josie, Jake, Jay, and Elizabeth.  Some of these friends have become practically family. Jay, David, Josie, Lucas, Irene, Tiago, Koustoubh, and Rehanah: thank you for all the amazing times we spent together. Meeting you, working with you, and sharing this journey with you has been both a blessing and a privilege.  

I would also like to thank Maria Maxouti, my lab partner since undergraduate days, with whom I now graduate once again at the same place. From UCL to Imperial, we have been on this journey together, and I am grateful for your friendship. To my friends in Cyprus, Marios Nicolaou, Andreas Chadjidemetriou, Andreas Chalarambous, Ioannis Mavridis, Konstantinos Kyratzis, Yiannis Pastos, and Lefteris Eleftheriadis, thank you for always being there despite the distance. Our countless laughs, the hours we spent together, and the memories we created have carried me through difficult times and reminded me of the importance of home. Even from afar, your friendship has been a constant source of joy and grounding.  I would also like to thank Maria Miscouridou, my flatmate for the past eight years. Thank you for tolerating me all this time. We have had a lot of fun living together, and those memories will always stay with me.  

I want to thank my partner, Elizabeth. It is no exaggeration to say that I would not have been on this path without you. Thank you for always being by my side, for your patience, and for your love. You have been my constant source of strength, and I feel truly lucky to have shared this journey with you.  I would also like to thank your family; Aristos, Christina, Filio, and Eleni, for their constant support, kindness, and all the fun times we have shared. A very special thank you goes to Elsa and Gregory for so often welcoming us into your home in London. The warmth of your hospitality, the wonderful company, and, of course, the amazing food made me feel like part of the family from the very beginning. To all of you: thank you for embracing me as one of your own and for making me feel so at home.  

Finally, I would like to thank my family. To my parents: your support throughout the years has been the foundation of everything I have achieved. Though you come from professions far removed from physics, you never stopped encouraging me to follow my dreams. I know that at times my explanations of what I do have been confusing (to be fair, I might just not be great at explaining it!), but your faith in me has never wavered. I am infinitely grateful for your unconditional love and support. To my brother, thank you for always being there in your own way, for reminding me not to take life too seriously, and for cheering me on from the sidelines. Your support has meant more to me than I can put into words. I would also like to thank my grandmother and my uncles/aunties, whose love and care have always surrounded me. In particular, Yiayia Maro has had a major influence on the way I was raised, and for that I will always be deeply grateful. 

To all my family and friends, near and far, thank you for shaping the person I am today and for being an endless source of strength and inspiration throughout this journey.
