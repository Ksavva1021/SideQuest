Motivated by the theoretical considerations and the particularly interesting muon $g-2$ measurement discussed in Section~\ref{Section:Chapter2_gminus2}, this chapter presents an analysis targeting final states with four $\PGt$ leptons through the $Z^*\rightarrow\phi A\rightarrow4\PGt$ process. This search for the Type-X 2HDM offers sensitivity to a region of parameter space in extended Higgs sector models that remains largely unexplored at hadron colliders. 

This chapter outlines the analysis strategy employed in the search. It begins with a brief overview of the datasets and simulated background samples used, followed by a description of the signal modelling. The subsequent sections detail the event reconstruction, selection criteria, and trigger requirements. Background estimation techniques are then discussed alongside the corrections applied to simulated samples and the treatment of systematic uncertainties. The chapter concludes with optimisation studies and the signal extraction procedure, which is presented in both a model-independent context and interpreted within the framework of the Type-X 2HDM.

\section{Datasets}

The Type-X 2HDM search presented in this chapter is based on pp collision data collected by the CMS detector during the 2016-2018 Run 2 data-taking period. The collisions were recorded at a centre-of-mass energy of $\sqrt{s} = 13\TeV$, as described in Section~\ref{Section:Chapter3_LHC}. The full dataset corresponds to an integrated luminosity of approximately $138\unit{fb}^{-1}$.
