In Chapter~\ref{Section:Chapter1}, the SM of particle physics was explored to establish the theoretical foundation of this work. While the SM has been immensely successful, with its predictions verified experimentally to a high degree of precision, it remains an incomplete theory of nature due to several fundamental theoretical problems. Beyond these theoretical issues, the emergence of experimental results in tension with SM predictions has sparked significant interest. Although the statistical significance of these tensions is not yet sufficient to claim new discoveries, the search for BSM physics to explain them remains an intriguing and active area of research. This chapter will focus on two major theoretical challenges; the hierarchy problem and the observed matter-antimatter asymmetry of the universe, while also discussing key experimental tensions. Possible solutions within the context of BSM physics will then be explored, with the observed Higgs boson playing an integral role in the matter-antimatter asymmetry discussion.

\section{Hierarchy problem}

A fundamental principle in theoretical physics is naturalness, which suggests that parameters in a theory should not take values that are unnaturally small or large without an underlying reason. In the case of the Standard Model (SM), this concept is particularly relevant to the Higgs boson mass, which is significantly smaller than the Planck scale ($m_P \approx 10^{19} \GeV$), where gravitational interactions become as strong as other fundamental forces.

Since the SM is widely regarded as an effective field theory (EFT), valid up to a certain energy scale, it is expected to require an extension at higher energies. The hierarchy problem arises from the absence of a natural mechanism to prevent large quantum corrections from driving the Higgs boson mass to much higher scales, typically near the Planck mass. This extreme disparity between the electroweak scale ($10^2 \GeV$) and the Planck scale remains one of the most significant unresolved questions in high-energy physics.

In QFT, the Higgs boson mass in not simply a fixed parameter. It receives corrections to its physical mass from virtual processes involving particles that couple directly or indirectly to the Higgs field. Mathematically the physical mass of the Higgs boson can be expressed as

\begin{equation}
    m_H^2 = (m_H^0)^2 + \Delta m_H^2
\label{Equation:Chapter2_HiggsBosonMass}
\end{equation}

where $m_H^0$ represent the bare mass of the Higgs boson, and $\Delta m_H$ term encapsulates the quantum loop corrections. In the EFT framework, the loop-induced correction term takes the form,

\begin{equation}
    \Delta m_H^2 = -\frac{g_f^2}{8\pi^2}\Lambda^2 + \space \text{...}
\end{equation}

where $\Lambda$ should be interpreted as the least energy scale at which new physics is expected to modify the high-energy behaviour of the theory. The Feynman diagram for the mass correction due to a fermion coupling to the Higgs field is shown in Fig.~\ref{Figure:Chapter2_Hierarchy_Feynman1}.

\begin{figure}[h]

\input{FeynmanDiagrams/HiggsCorrection_FermionLoop}
\caption{TODO}
\label{Figure:Chapter2_Hierarchy_Feynman1}
\end{figure}

At the core of the hierarchy problem lies this $\Lambda$ term. If $\Lambda$ is taken to be close to the Plank scale, these quantum loop correction become many orders of magnitude larger than the observed mass of the Higgs boson, $125.38 \pm 0.14~\GeV$ (in natural units). To reconcile this, an extreme degree of fine-tuning in Eq.~\ref{Equation:Chapter2_HiggsBosonMass} is required. Specifically, the bare mass term has to be sufficiently large ($\mathcal{O}(10^{38})$ to cancel out the quantum loop correction term. This degree of unnatural finetuning remains an open question in the field, as the Higgs mass would otherwise be expected close to the scale of new physics. This could suggest that new physics may exist near $\Lambda$, that can stabilise the Higgs mass and resolve the hierarchy problem. 

Perhaps, the most studied and appealing solution to the hierarchy problem is \ac{SUSY}, which introduces a symmetry relating fermions and bosons. In SUSY, every known SM particle has at least one supersymmetric partner. Bosons have fermionic superpartners while, fermions have scalar boson superpartners. This symmetry provides a natural way of addressing this extreme fine-tuning, as superpartners also contribute to $\Delta m_H^2$ but, with opposite signs relative to their SM counterparts. This allows the Higgs mass to stabilise naturally through the cancellation of the quantum loop corrections. The Feynman diagram for the mass correction due to a fermionic superpartner (scalar boson) is shown in Fig.~\ref{Figure:Chapter2_Hierarchy_Feynman2}.

\end{figure}

While SUSY provides a natural solution to the hierarchy problem, the lack of any experimental evidence for supersymmetric partners, along with strong experimental constraints on the simplest SUSY extension of the SM (MSSM), has lead to alternative extensions to the SM Higgs sector gaining traction. One such extension is the \ac{2HDM}, where the introduction of additional Higgs bosons that could alter the running of coupling constants and loop corrections. Moreover, 2HDMs are particularly interesting in light of the muon $g-2$ anomaly, which will be discussed in this chapter.

\section{Extended Higgs sector - 2HDM}

The simplest extension to the SM Higgs sector is the 2HDM. In contrast to the SM, the 2HDM introduces two complex scalar $SU(2)_L$ doublets, $\Phi_1$ and $\Phi_2$.

\begin{equation}
\Phi_i =
\begin{pmatrix}
\phi_i^{+} \\
\phi_i^{0} 
\end{pmatrix}
\quad ,\quad i = 1,2
\end{equation}

The presence of the additional doublet in 2HDM leads to a richer potential structure. The general 2HDM Higgs potential, written in terms of the doublets $\Phi_1$ and $\Phi_2$, takes the form,

In contrast to the SM Higgs potential, the 2HDM counterpart exhibits an extended form because of the presence of the additional doublet

\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{c}
    V(\Phi_1,\Phi_2) = m_{11}^2 \Phi_1^{\dagger}\Phi_1 + m_{22}^2 \Phi_2^{\dagger}\Phi_2 - m_{12}^2(\Phi_1^\dagger\Phi_2 + \text{H.c.}) \\
    + \frac{1}{2} \lambda_1(\Phi_1^\dagger\Phi_1)^2 + \frac{1}{2}\lambda_2(\Phi_2^\dagger\Phi_2)^2 + \lambda_3(\Phi_1^\dagger\Phi_1)(\Phi_2^\dagger\Phi_2) \\
    + \lambda_4(\Phi_1^\dagger\Phi_2)(\Phi_2^\dagger\Phi_1) + \frac{1}{2}\lambda_5[(\Phi_1^\dagger\Phi_2)^2 + (\Phi_2^\dagger\Phi_1)^2] \\
    + \lambda_6(\Phi_1^\dagger\Phi_1)(\Phi_1^\dagger\Phi_2) + \lambda_7(\Phi_2^\dagger\Phi_2)(\Phi_1^\dagger\Phi_2)
\end{array}
\end{equation}

where the scalar potential is expressed in terms of the mass parameters ($m_{ij}$) and the quartic couplings ($\lambda_i$). 

A major constraint imposed in 2HDMs is the suppression of tree-level \ac{FCNC}. In a generic 2HDM, both Higgs doublet can couple to the same fermion flavour, which lead to non-diagonal Yukawa couplings after SSB. These couplings are strongly constrained by experimental data. To forbid these tree-level interactions, a discrete $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry \cite{2HDM(2)} is introduced, 

\begin{equation}
    \Phi_1 \to \Phi_1, \Phi_2 \to - \Phi_2, \Phi_1 \not\to \Phi_2 
\end{equation}

This ensures that each fermion type couples to only one of the Higgs doublets. Following the introduction of the discrete symmetry, the quartic interaction terms $\lambda_6$ and $\lambda_7$ are also eliminated from the potential. In addition to suppressing flavor-changing neutral currents (FCNCs), charge-parity (CP) symmetry plays a crucial role in ensuring the theoretical consistency of 2HDMs. CP symmetry is a fundamental symmetry in quantum field theory (QFT) that combines charge conjugation (C) and parity (P). Under a charge conjugation transformation, particles are transformed into their corresponding antiparticles whilst, parity transformations invert the spatial coordinates. In 2HDM, CP conservation is often imposd to prevent spontaneous CP violation. to maintain CP symmetry, all free parameters in the Higgs potential are required to be real.

In the 2HDM, electroweak symmetry breaking occurs similarly to the SM. To preserve the $U(1)_{EM}$ gauge symmetry, only the neutral components of the Higgs doublets acquire non-zero VEVs, ensuring that the photon remains massless. The vacuum structure is given by,

\begin{equation}
    <0|\Phi_i|0> = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{pmatrix}
        0 \\
        \nu_i
    \end{pmatrix} \quad,\quad i=1,2
\end{equation}

where $\nu_1$ and $\nu_2$ are the VEVs associated with each Higgs doublet.

After SSB, the Higgs doublets can be expanded around the minima

\begin{equation}
    \text{SSB} \rightarrow\Phi_i = \begin{pmatrix}
        \phi_i^+ \\
        \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(\nu_i + h_i + iz_i)
    \end{pmatrix} \quad,\quad i=1,2
\end{equation}

where the doublets have been expressed in terms of CP-even ($h_i$), CP-odd ($z_i$) and charged Higgs fields ($\phi_i^+$).

Analogous to the SM Higgs sector, the introduction of a second Higgs doublet introduces an additional 4 dof. Upon SSB, 3 out of the 8 dof are absorbed as Goldstone bosons providing the W$^{\pm}$ and Z bosons with longitudinal dof while the remaining 5 dof correspond to 5 physical Higgs bosons; 2 CP-even (h and H), 1 CP-odd (A) and 2 charged Higgs bosons (H$^{\pm}$). The mass eigenstates corresponding to these physical Higgs bosons are admixtures of the components of the two Higgs doublets in Eq.~\ref{Equation:Chapter2_2HDM-MassEigenstates}.

\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{c}
     h = h_1 \sin{\alpha} - h_2 \cos{\alpha} \\
     H = - h_1 \cos{\alpha} - h_2 \sin{\alpha} \\
     H^\pm = \phi_1^+ \sin{\beta} + \phi_2^+ \cos{\beta} \\
     A = z_1 \sin{\beta} - z_2 \cos{\beta}
\end{array}
\label{Equation:Chapter2_2HDM-MassEigenstates}
\end{equation}

where the parameter $\alpha$ governs the mixing between the CP-even scalars and $\beta$ is a rotational angle that diagonalises the mass-squared matrices of the pseudoscalar and the charged Higgs, defined as,

\begin{equation}
    \tan{\beta} = \nu_2/\nu_1
\end{equation}

To ensure the theoretical consistency and predictability within the 2HDM, the degree of mixing needs to be carefully controlled. This is achieved once again through a discrete $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry. However, rather being strictly imposed, the symmetry is softly broken by the $m_{12}^2$ term in the scalar potential. This soft-breaking of the symmetry allows the Yukawa couplings to remain flavour diagonal while, simultaneously allowing for mixing between the Higgs doublets ($\Phi_i$). Following the introduction of $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry, the CP-conserving 2HDMs are split in different types, which are defined based on which Higgs doublet couples to each fermion flavour. The four types of CP-conserving 2HDMs are shown in Table~\ref{Table:Chapter2_2HDM-Types}.

In each 2HDM type, the structure of the Yukawa interactions depend on the specific assignment of the fermion couplings to the Higgs doublets. After SSB, the Yukawa part of the 2HDM Lagrangian can be expressed in terms of the physical Higgs mass eigenstates, up-like ($u$) and down-like($d$) quark, charged lepton ($l$) and neutrino ($\upsilon$) fields as

\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
    \text{SSB} \rightarrow \mathcal{L}_{Yukawa}^{2HDM} &= - \sum\limits_{f=u,d,l} \frac{m_f}{\nu} 
    \left(g_f^h \overline{f}f h + g_f^H\overline{f}f H - i g_f^A\overline{f} \gamma_5 f A \right) \\
    &\quad - \left\{ \frac{\sqrt{2}V_{ud}}{\nu} \overline{u} 
    \left(m_u g_u^A P_L + m_d g_d^A P_R \right) d H^+ \right. \\
    &\quad \left. + \frac{\sqrt{2}m_l g_{l}^A}{\nu} \overline{\upsilon
_L} l_R H^+ + H.c. \right\}
\end{aligned}
\label{Equation:Chapter2_2HDM-YukawaLagrangian}
\end{equation}

where $g_f^H,g_f^A,g_f^h$ are the normalised Yukawa couplings of the fermions to the Higgs mass eigenstates, expressed relative to the SM Higgs boson's couplings. These couplings are summarised in Table~\ref{Table:Chapter2_2HDM-Couplings} for each of the four types of 2HDMs.

In 2HDMs, the observed Higgs boson can be matched to the predicted CP-even bosons by a linear combination of the two mass eigenstates 

\begin{equation}
    h_{\text{obs}} = \sin{(\beta - \alpha)} h + \cos{(\beta - \alpha)} H 
\end{equation}

In the Higgs alignment limit, one of these CP-even neutral Higgs boson is the observed Higgs, which enables two possible alignment scenarios, the normal and inverted scenarios. In the normal scenario, the observed Higgs is identified as the lighter h in 2HDM, in contrast to H being identified as the observed Higgs in the inverted scenario (Eqs.~\ref{Equation:Chapter2-NormalScenario,Equation:Chapter2-InvertedScenario}. The adjusted couplings of the unmatched CP-even boson are summarised in Table~\ref{Table:Chapter2_2HDM-CouplingsAlignmentLimit} for each of the four different types of 2HDMs.

\section{\texorpdfstring{Muon $g$-2 anomaly}{Muon g-2 anomaly}}

In 2023, Fermilab announced the most precise measurement of the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon, $\alpha_\mu$. Combined with the earlier result from the Brookhaven National Laboratory, the experimental average of the muon anomaly exhibits a 5.0~$\sigma$ discrepancy from SM prediction compiled by the Muon $g-2$ Theory Initiative in 2020. This is a definitely an intriguing result, as it could be a hint of BSM physics, however, caution is also warranted, as there also tensions between the different theoretical calculations that could bring the prediction closer to the experimental value.


\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
    \alpha_\mu (SM) &= 116591810(43) \times 10^{-11} \\
    \alpha_\mu (\text{exp}) &= 116592059(22) \times 10^{-11} \quad (0.19~\text{ppm}) \\
    \Delta \alpha_\mu &= (249\pm48) \times 10^{-11}
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}

A possible explanation for the discrepancy between the experimental measurements and the theoretical prediction of the $g-2$ anomaly can be accommodated by 2HDMs. In 2HDMs, the additional Higgs bosons can introduce loop corrections to the calculation of $\alpha_\mu$, through one-loop and two-loop Barr-Zee interactions presented in Fig.~\ref{TODO} and Fig.~\ref{TODO} respectively. The one-loop contributions are mediated by $\phi$, A and H$^{\pm}$ with the contribution of $\phi$ to $\Delta\alpha_\mu$ being positive $\alpha_\mu$ while those of A and H$^{\pm}$ are negative. The dominant contribution comes from two-loop Barr-Zee type diagrams with heavy fermions in the loop providing a positive shift to $\Delta\alpha_\mu$, with the CP-odd Higgs boson contributing positively primarily through the top quark loop. However, the contribution from the additional CP-even boson can have either a positive or a negative impact, depending on $\tan{\beta}$. 

For the $g-2$ anomaly to be explained by 2HDMs, enhanced couplings between muons and the additional Higgs bosons are required. These enhanced couplings can be fascilitated by the type II and type X 2HDMs at large values of $\tan{\beta}$. The type II 2HDM also features enhanced coupling to down-type quarks, leading to gluon fusion and associated production with bottom quarks being the dominant single Higgs boson production modes. However, finding regions of parameter space within this model that can explain the $g-2$ anomaly is challenging because of the productions mechanisms being heavily constrained by experimental searches at LEP, Tevatron and LHC. On the other hand, the type X 2HDM is particularly interesting because of its hadrophobic nature, featuring suppressed up- and down-type quark couplings with increased $\tan{\beta}$. This suppression allows it to evade the experimentally constrained quark-initiated production modes, leaving much of its parameter space relatively untouched. As a result, the type X 2HDM remains a more viable candidate for explaining the $g-2$ anomaly. 

In addition to collider constraints, the available parameter space is further shaped by theoretical considerations including vacuum stability and perturbative unitarity, as well as electroweak precision measurements. The regions where the $g-2$ anomaly can be accommodated within the type X 2HDM in both alignment scenarios are summarized in Table~\ref{Table:Chapter2_TypeX-ParameterSpace}.

\section{CP Nature of the SM Higgs boson}


- baryonic assymetry requires a certain amount of CP violation 
- Charge conjugation C and parity P are discrete symmetries
which convert a particle into its antiparticle and a left-handed particle into a right-handed
particle through the sign reversal of Cartesian coordinates, respectively. Although CP violation
has been observed so far only in the quark sector, the amount of violation is too small to be
consistent with models that explain the baryonic asymmetry observed, such as Sakharov’s
model of baryogenesis
- Strong evidence for CP violation in neutrino oscillations has been
discovered more recently [25]. This naturally raises the question whether or not CP violation
may be observed in other areas of the SM. Of particular interest is the Higgs sector, meaning
the collection of fields and particles that give rise to the Higgs mechanism. As previously
discussed in this Chapter, the Higgs boson is the only particle in the SM that is responsible
for generating the masses of fermions and gauge bosons, however, extensions to the SM exist which predict a Higgs sector consisting of more fields and particles. The simplest possible
extension to the SM is achieved through the introduction of a second complex SU(2) doublet.
Models of this kind are known as two-Higgs-doublet models (2HDM) and manifest themselves
through a myriad of theories [26].
In the SM, the Higgs sector comprises only the single Higgs boson, as was depicted in Figure 2.1.
This boson is a spin-zero scalar particle, and is therefore adheres to CP symmetry. A CP-odd
spin-zero Higgs boson is not allowed in the SM, but would manifest itself as a parity-odd
boson through its asymmetry under rotational transformations, which in turn can be inferred
on through angular correlations of particles associated to its production or decay. In a generic
2HDM, however, the Higgs sector consists of three neutral Higgs boson and two charged
Higgs bosons. In CP-violating cases, the neutral Higgs bosons are not eigenstates of the
tandem CP operation, as would be the case for the SM Higgs boson, but are compositions
of CP-even and CP-odd components. To add the possibility of a CP-violating component in
the SM Lagrangian describing the interaction between the Higgs boson resonance h(x) and
fermions of flavour f we can write the Lagrangian [27] as
