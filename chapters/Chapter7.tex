\section{Introduction}
\label{Section:Chapter7_Introduction}
As outlined in Section~\ref{Section:Chapter2_CP_Yukawa_Structure}, the CP structure of the Higgs-tau Yukawa coupling can be probed through spin correlations in $H \to \tau\tau$ decays. These correlations are captured in the acoplanarity angle $\phi_{CP}$ between the $\tau^+$ and $\tau^-$ decay planes, which serves as the primary CP-sensitive observable.

In the \ac{SM}, this measurement is expressed in terms of the effective CP mixing angle $\alpha^{\PH\tau\tau}$ (defined in Section~\ref{Section:Chapter2_HiggsCPStructurethroughHttdecays}), predicted to be essentially zero for a purely CP-even interaction. A significant deviation of $\alpha^{\PH\tau\tau}$ from zero would be direct evidence for CP violation in the Higgs–fermion sector, with important implications for physics beyond the \ac{SM}. Minimal supersymmetric models predict only negligible CP-violating effects in Yukawa couplings, whereas extended Higgs sectors such as the next-to-minimal supersymmetric model can accommodate values up to ${\sim}27^\circ$~\cite{King:2015oxa}.

The most precise determination to date was performed by the \ac{CMS} Collaboration using the full Run 2 dataset of $137~\mathrm{fb}^{-1}$ at $\sqrt{s} = 13~\mathrm{TeV}$~\cite{HiggsCP_CMS_2021}. That analysis combined multiple $\tau$ decay channels, including leptonic modes ($\tau_e^\pm,\ \tau_\mu^\pm$) and the dominant hadronic modes ($\pi^\pm$, $\rho^\pm \to \pi^\pm \pi^0$, $a_1^\pm \to \pi^\pm \pi^0 \pi^0$, $a_1^\pm \to \pi^\pm \pi^\mp \pi^\pm$). The result, $\alpha^{\PH\tau\tau} = -1 \pm 19^\circ$, compared to an expected $0 \pm 21^\circ$ at the 68.3\% CL, disfavouring the pure CP-odd scenario at $3.0\sigma$, was dominated by statistical uncertainty. Feasibility studies indicate that a precision of ${\sim}5$-$10^\circ$ could be achieved with $3\unit{ab}^{-1}$ of data~\cite{Harnik:2013aja,Berge:2014sra}.

This chapter presents a complementary measurement targeting only the $\PGt_h \PGt_h$ final state. The dataset corresponds to the partial Run 3 data-taking period and is substantially smaller in integrated luminosity than in Run 2, leading to reduced statistical reach. Despite the smaller dataset, this analysis aims to approach the precision of the Run 2 results by targeting improvements in key components such as:

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\roman*)]
    \item Tau identification
    \item Triggering
    \item Tau \ac{DM} classification
    \item Event Categorisation
    \item Reconstruction of the sensitive observable
\end{enumerate}

These developments are aimed at paving the way to a competitive measurement well before the \ac{HL}-\ac{LHC} era, and will be discussed in more detail throughout this chapter, along with an improved analysis strategy.

\section{Collision data}

This analysis uses proton–proton collision data recorded by the \ac{CMS} detector during the initial part of the Run 3 period (2022–2023). The collisions were produced at a centre-of-mass energy of $\sqrt{s} = 13.6\TeV$, and the dataset corresponds to an integrated luminosity of about $61.9\unit{fb}^{-1}$.

\section{Backgrounds}
\label{Section:Chapter7_Backgrounds}

Many of the background processes relevant to the fully hadronic ditau ($\PGt_h\PGt_h$) final state are the same as those discussed for the four-tau analysis in Section~\ref{Section:Chapter6_Backgrounds}. The main difference is that the present selection requires only two reconstructed tau candidates, both hadronically decaying. Events can enter the signal region through three main mechanisms:  

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\roman*)]
    \item Production of two genuine $\PGt_h$ leptons  
    \item Production of one genuine $\PGt_h$ and one misidentified object (jet or prompt electron/muon reconstructed) as $\PGt_h$
    \item Production of two misidentified objects, typically jets or nonprompt electrons/muons, both reconstructed as $\PGt_h$
\end{enumerate}

Relative to the four-tau case, the composition and ranking of backgrounds change noticeably.  \textbf{\ac{DY}} ($\PZ/\gamma^*\to\PGt^+\PGt^-$) with both taus decaying hadronically is now the dominant source of genuine $\PGt_h\PGt_h$ pairs. \textbf{Top-quark pair production} ($\ttbar$) also makes a large contribution, both through $\PW\to\PGt\nu_\PGt$ decays (genuine $\PGt_h$) and through the misidentification of jets or prompt leptons as $\PGt_h$, with the associated $b$-jets increasing the likelihood of additional jet activity. Backgrounds from \textbf{$\PW$+jets} and \textbf{\ac{QCD}-induced multijet production} are similarly important, as only one or two jet$\to\PGt_h$ (or $e/\mu\to\PGt_h$) misidentifications are needed to pass the $\PGt_h\PGt_h$ selection.  

In contrast to the four-tau analysis, where \textbf{$ZZ\to4\PGt$} was the most important irreducible background, $ZZ$ production is subdominant. This is because events with four taus rarely pass the $\PGt_h\PGt_h$ selection unless two of the taus are outside the detector acceptance or fail identification. Other processes, including triboson and single-top production, remain subdominant.

The modelling and estimation strategies for these background contributions, including the treatment of jet and lepton misidentification, are detailed in Section~\ref{Section:Chapter7_Background_Modelling}. The full list of simulated background processes is broadly similar to that presented for the four-tau analysis in Table~\ref{Table:Chapter6_SimulatedBackgrounds}, and is reproduced here in Table~\ref{Table:Chapter7_SimulatedBackgrounds} for completeness.

\section{Modelling of signal processes}
\label{Section:Chapter7_SignalModelling}

The signal samples used in this analysis correspond to Higgs boson production through \ac{ggH}, \ac{VBF}, and \ac{VH} ($\PW\PH$, $\PZ\PH$). All samples are generated with the \POWHEG v2.0 event generator~\cite{Powheg_0,Powheg_1,Powheg_2,Powheg_3}. To ensure that the measurement of $\alpha_{\PH\tau\tau}$ remains unbiased with respect to possible assumptions about the CP structure in the Higgs boson production mechanism, observables that are directly sensitive to the production CP properties are not considered. In particular, variables such as the azimuthal separation between the two leading jets are excluded from the event selection.

As for the background samples discussed in Section~\ref{Section:Chapter7_Backgrounds}, the $\PGt$ decays are simulated with \PYTHIA (version 8.230)~\cite{PYTHIA}. At this stage, the spins of the tau pair are treated as uncorrelated. The proper spin correlations, which encode the CP-sensitive effects of the $\PH \to \tau\tau$ interaction, are subsequently incorporated using the \TAUSPINNER package~\cite{Przedzinski:2018ett}. This tool computes per-event weights corresponding to benchmark CP scenarios:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Pure CP-even ($\alpha^{\PH\tau\tau} = 0^\circ$) 
    \item Pure CP-odd ($\alpha^{\PH\tau\tau} = 90^\circ$) 
    \item Maximally mixed ($\alpha^{\PH\tau\tau} = 45^\circ$) 
\end{itemize}  

These weights allow the construction of differential distributions at arbitrary values of the effective mixing angle through linear combinations of the benchmark templates. In practice, this is achieved using the decomposition:  

\begin{equation_pad}
\begin{aligned}
    \frac{d\sigma}{dx}(\alpha^{\PH\tau\tau}) 
    &= (\cos^2\alpha^{\PH\tau\tau} - \cos\alpha^{\PH\tau\tau}\sin\alpha^{\PH\tau\tau})  \frac{d\sigma}{dx}\Big|_{\text{CP-even}} \\
    &+ (\sin^2\alpha^{\PH\tau\tau} - \cos\alpha^{\PH\tau\tau}\sin\alpha^{\PH\tau\tau})  \frac{d\sigma}{dx}\Big|_{\text{CP-odd}}\\
    &+ 2\cos\alpha^{\PH\tau\tau}\sin\alpha^{\PH\tau\tau} \, \frac{d\sigma}{dx}\Big|_{\text{CP-mix}}
\end{aligned}
\end{equation_pad} 

\section{Reconstruction of \texorpdfstring{$\phi_{CP}$}{phiCP}}
\label{Section:Chapter7_PhiCP_Reconstruction}
As discussed in Section~\ref{Section:Chapter2_HiggsCPStructurethroughHttdecays}, $\phi_{CP}$ is formally defined through the \ac{PV}s of the two $\tau$ leptons. In the Higgs boson rest frame, this construction provides the optimal estimator of the $\tau$ spin correlations and therefore of the CP structure of the $\PH\tau\tau$ interaction. 

Experimentally, a full reconstruction of the \ac{PV} is rarely possible. Most $\tau$ decays involve one or more neutrinos, whose momenta cannot be well constrained, hence preventing the complete reconstruction of the $\tau$ rest frames. As a result, direct access to the Higgs rest frame is limited to only a subset of \acp{DM}. To overcome these challenges, alternative reconstruction frames and methods have been developed. 

To make the measurement experimentally accessible, $\phi_{CP}$ is reconstructed in the zero-momentum frame (ZMF) of two visible $\tau$ decay products. This is justified by the fact that the spin information of the $\tau$ leptons is imprinted onto their decay products. The planes reconstructed from these visible products therefore inherit the spin correlations, and their relative orientation continues to encode the CP properties of the $\PH\tau\tau$ coupling. 

In the remainder of this section, the different reconstruction strategies employed are described in more detail. Throughout, the symbol $\phi_{CP}$ is used generically to denote the reconstructed acoplanarity angle, irrespective of the specific method chosen.

\subsection{Impact parameter method}
\label{Section:Chapter7_IP_METHOD}
The \ac{IP} method exploits the finite lifetime of $\tau$ leptons to approximate their decay planes using tracking information. This method offers \textit{optimal CP sensitivity} when both taus decay into a single charged particle.

The basic principle of the method is to reconstruct each $\tau$ decay plane using the spatial momentum of the charged decay product ($\mathbf{q^\pm}$) together with its associated \ac{IP} vector ($\mathbf{n^\pm}$), as defined in Section~\ref{Section:Chapter4_Vertex_reconstruction}. These quantities are expressed as four-vectors: the charged-particle momentum $q^\pm$ and the impact-parameter vector $n^\pm=(0,\mathbf{n^\pm})$, both measured in the laboratory frame. The set of four-vectors is then boosted into the rest frame of the two charged particles, \ie the visible ditau \ac{ZMF} (denoted by $_\text{ZMF}$). In the \ac{ZMF}, the boosted \ac{IP} three-vector is normalised and decomposed into components parallel and transverse to the direction of the corresponding normalised three-momentum vector of the charged particle. From these vectors, two key observables are constructed: $\phi_{\text{ZMF}}$ and $O_{\text{ZMF}}$\footnote{The triple product observable $O_{\text{ZMF}}$ resolves the twofold ambiguity inherent in the angle between decay planes, which would otherwise be confined to the interval $[0,\pi]$. Its sign encodes the relative orientation (clockwise or anticlockwise) of the planes, thereby unfolding the acoplanarity angle to the full range $[0,2\pi]$ and retaining sensitivity to the CP phase of the $\PH\tau\tau$ coupling.}.
\begin{equation_pad}
    \phi_{\text{ZMF}} = \arccos(\hat{\mathbf{n}}_{\text{ZMF},\perp}^{+} \, \, \cdot \, \, \hat{\mathbf{n}}_{\text{ZMF},\perp}^{-})
\end{equation_pad}
\begin{equation_pad}
    O_{\text{ZMF}} = \hat{\mathbf{q}}^-_\text{ZMF} \, \, \cdot \, \,(\hat{\mathbf{n}}_{\text{ZMF},\perp}^{+} \, \, \times \, \, \hat{\mathbf{n}}_{\text{ZMF},\perp}^{-})
\end{equation_pad}

The acoplanarity angle is then defined over the full range $[0,2\pi]$ by:

\begin{equation_pad}
\phi_{CP} \;=\;
\begin{cases}
\phi_{\text{ZMF}} & O_{\text{ZMF}} \ge 0 \\
2\pi - \phi_{\text{ZMF}} & O_{\text{ZMF}} < 0
\end{cases}
\end{equation_pad}

The performance of the \ac{IP} method is illustrated by the reconstructed $\phi_{CP}$ distributions in the single-prong final states ($\pi\pi$), shown in Fig.~\ref{Figure:CPDist_IPMethod_pipi}.

\begin{figure}[!htbp]

    {Reconstructed distribution of the acoplanarity angle $\phi_{CP}$ in the $\tauh\tauh \to \pi\pi$ final state, obtained with the \ac{IP} method. The plots are obtained from the signal samples used in this analysis.}
    \label{Figure:CPDist_IPMethod_pipi}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Neutral-pion method}
\label{Section:NeutralPionMethod}

The \ac{NP} method, also referred to as the \textit{decay-plane method}, targets $\tau$ decays proceeding through the $\rho^\pm$ resonance, \ie $\tau^\pm \to \rho^\pm \nu_\tau$ with $\rho^\pm \to \pi^\pm \pi^0$. In this case, the $\tau$ decay plane is reconstructed directly from the momentum vectors of the charged pion ($\mathbf{q^\pm}$) and the neutral pion ($\mathbf{q^{0\pm}}$). The \ac{NP} momentum therefore plays the role of the secondary axis defining the plane, effectively replacing the \ac{IP} vector used in the \ac{IP} method (Section~\ref{Section:Chapter7_IP_METHOD}).  

In analogy with the IP construction, the acoplanarity angle is first defined as
\begin{equation_pad}
    \phi_{\text{ZMF}} = \arccos(\hat{\mathbf{q}}^{0+}_{\text{ZMF},\perp} \cdot \hat{\mathbf{q}}^{0-}_{\text{ZMF},\perp}),
\end{equation_pad}

where the transverse components of the \ac{NP} momenta are taken with respect to the associated charged-pion directions in the visible ditau \ac{ZMF}. To resolve the twofold ambiguity, a triple product observable is constructed as

\begin{equation_pad}
    O_{\text{ZMF}} = \hat{\mathbf{q}}^-_{\text{ZMF}} \cdot (\hat{\mathbf{q}}^{0+}_{\text{ZMF},\perp} \times \hat{\mathbf{q}}^{0-}_{\text{ZMF},\perp}),
\end{equation_pad}

The sign of $O_{\text{ZMF}}$ unfolds the angle to the full $[0,2\pi]$ range,

\begin{equation_pad}
\phi^{\prime}_{CP} =
\begin{cases}
\phi_{\text{ZMF}} & O_{\text{ZMF}} \ge 0 \\
2\pi - \phi_{\text{ZMF}} & O_{\text{ZMF}} < 0
\end{cases}
\end{equation_pad}  

so that $\phi^\prime_{CP}$ serves as the signed acoplanarity angle. An additional refinement, specific to the $\rho$ channel, exploits the \emph{spin-analyser function}

\begin{equation_pad}
    y_\rho^\pm = \frac{E_{\pi^\pm} - E_{\pi^0}}{E_{\pi^\pm} + E_{\pi^0}},
\end{equation_pad}

where $E_{\pi^\pm}$ and $E_{\pi^0}$ are the energies of the charged and neutral pions in the laboratory frame. The product $y_\rho^+ y_\rho^-$ encodes the relative orientation of the spin-analyser vectors for the two $\tau$ decays. The final CP-sensitive observable is thus defined as

\begin{equation_pad}
\phi_{CP} =
\begin{cases}
\phi^\prime_{CP} & y_\rho^+ y_\rho^- \geq 0 \\
\phi^\prime_{CP} + \pi \; \,(\text{mod } 2\pi) & y_\rho^+ y_\rho^- < 0
\end{cases}
\end{equation_pad}

The sensitivity of the \ac{NP} method is demonstrated in Fig.~\ref{Figure:CPDist_NPMethod}, which shows the reconstructed $\phi_{CP}$ distributions for the $\rho\rho$ \ac{DM}.

\end{figure}

\subsection{\ac{PV} method in the $a_1^{3\mathrm{pr}}a_1^{3\mathrm{pr}}$ channel}
\label{Section:Chapter7_PV_Method}
The \ac{PV} method exploits the fact that, for certain $\tau$ decay modes, the full kinematics of the $\tau$ lepton can be reconstructed with sufficient accuracy. This is the case when both $\tau$ leptons decay via the $a_1 \to 3\pi$ mode, in which the \acp{SV} can be reconstructed from the three charged tracks of each decay. The $\tau$ lepton momentum direction is taken from the line connecting the \ac{PV} and \ac{SV}. Its magnitude is determined using the two-body decay kinematics $\tau \to a_1\nu_\tau$ under the assumption of $m_\tau$ and $m_{a_1}$ fixed to their nominal values and a massless neutrino as

\begin{equation_pad}
|\vec{p}_\tau| = 
\frac{(m_{a_1}^2 + m_\tau^2)\,|\vec{p}_{a_1}| \cos\theta_{\mathrm{GJ}} \;\pm\; 
\sqrt{(m_{a_1}^2 + |\vec{p}_{a_1}|^2)\,\big[(m_{a_1}^2 - m_\tau^2)^2 - 4m_\tau^2 |\vec{p}_{a_1}|^2 \sin^2\theta_{\mathrm{GJ}}\big]}}
{2\,(m_{a_1}^2 + |\vec{p}_{a_1}|^2 \sin^2\theta_{\mathrm{GJ}})}.
\label{Equation:TauPTMag_PV}
\end{equation_pad}

where the solution involves the Gottfried-Jackson angle $\theta_{\mathrm{GJ}}$~\cite{Cherepanov:2018npf}, defined as the angle between the $\tau$ and $a_1$ momenta in the lab frame. This is constrained to lie within a physical maximum $\theta_{\mathrm{GJ}}^{\mathrm{max}}$. In practice, finite detector resolution may lead to $\theta_{\mathrm{GJ}} > \theta_{\mathrm{GJ}}^{\mathrm{max}}$, in which case the value is truncated.  

Equation~\ref{Equation:TauPTMag_PV} admits two possible solutions for the magnitude of the $\tau$ lepton momentum. This ambiguity arises because, in the $\tau$ rest frame, the $a_1$ meson can be emitted either in the same direction as, or opposite to, the $\tau$ momentum in the laboratory frame. The case where the $a_1$ is emitted orthogonally corresponds to the unique solution in which the square root term vanishes. When applied to both $\tau$ decays in an event, this leads in general to up to four candidate solutions for the pair of $\tau$ momenta. The ambiguity is resolved by choosing the solution whose reconstructed ditau mass is closest to the nominal Higgs boson mass.

With the $\tau$ four-momenta determined, the \ac{PV}s $\mathbf{h}_1$ and $\mathbf{h}_2$ are computed using the resonance model implemented in \TAUOLA~\cite{Jadach:1990mz,Jezabek:1991qp,Jadach:1993hs}, calibrated with experimental parameters from CLEO~\cite{CLEO:1999rzk}. In order to build a CP-sensitive observable, $\mathbf{k_{1,2}}$ vectors are defined

\begin{equation_pad}
\mathbf{\hat{k}}_{1,2} = \frac{\mathbf{\hat{h}}_{1,2} \times \mathbf{\hat{n}}_{1,2}}{|\mathbf{\hat{h}}_{1,2} \times \mathbf{\hat{n}}_{1,2}|},
\end{equation_pad}

where $\mathbf{\hat{n}}_{1,2}$ denote the unit vectors of the $\tau$ momenta in the Higgs boson rest frame. From these, the acoplanarity angle $\phi^*$ and the triple product observable $O^*$ are constructed as  
\begin{equation_pad}
    \phi^* = \arccos(\vec{k}_1 \cdot \vec{k}_2)
\end{equation_pad}
\begin{equation_pad}
    O^* = - (\mathbf{\hat{h}}_1 \times \mathbf{\hat{h}}_2) \cdot \mathbf{\hat{n}}_1
\end{equation_pad}

where $^*$ denotes the Higgs rest frame. The final CP-sensitive observable is thus defined as

\begin{equation_pad}
\phi_{CP} \;=\;
\begin{cases}
\phi^* & O^* \ge 0 \\
2\pi - \phi^* & O^* < 0
\end{cases}
\end{equation_pad}

An example of the $\phi_{CP}$ distributions reconstructed with the \ac{PV} method in the $a_1^{3\mathrm{pr}}a_1^{3\mathrm{pr}}$ \ac{DM} is presented in Fig.~\ref{Figure:CPDist_PVMethod}.

    \label{Figure:CPDist_PVMethod}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Combined methods}
\label{Section:Chapter7_CombinedMethods}

The first combined method utilises both the \ac{IP} and \ac{NP} techniques, applied in channels where the two $\tau$ leptons decay through different modes. In particular, this strategy is relevant when one $\tau$ decays to a resonance with neutral pions (e.g.\ $\rho \to \pi^\pm \pi^0$ or $a_1 \to \pi^\pm 2\pi^0$), while the other $\tau$ undergoes a single-prong decay without neutral pions. In such cases, the decay plane of the $\tau$ with neutral pions is reconstructed with the \ac{NP} method, while the other is reconstructed with the impact-parameter method. The two planes are then combined in the visible ditau \ac{ZMF} to define $\phi_{CP}$. A subtlety arises because the \ac{NP} method introduces an additional sign ambiguity, shifting $\phi_{CP}$:

\begin{equation_pad}
\phi_{CP} =
\begin{cases}
\phi^\prime_{CP} & y_\rho \geq 0 \\
\phi^\prime_{CP} + \pi \; \,(\text{mod } 2\pi) & y_\rho < 0
\end{cases}
\end{equation_pad}

The resulting $\phi_{CP}$ distributions obtained with the \ac{IP}-\ac{NP} combined method are shown in Fig.~\ref{Figure:CPDist_Combined_IP_NP}, illustrating the complementarity of the different approaches across \acp{DM}.

\begin{figure}[!htbp]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{Figures/Chapter7/Acoplanarity/With_IP/aco_pi_rho.pdf}
    \caption[Reconstructed $\phi_{CP}$ distribution in $\pi\rho$ final states using the IP-NP combined method.]
    {Reconstructed distribution of the acoplanarity angle $\phi_{CP}$ in the $\tauh\tauh \to \pi\rho$ final state, obtained with the \ac{IP}-\ac{NP} combined method. The plots are obtained from the signal samples used in this analysis.}
    \label{Figure:CPDist_Combined_IP_NP}
\end{figure}

The second combined method arises when one $\tau$ lepton decays via the $a_1^\text{3pr}$ mode, while the other follows a single-prong decay that can be reconstructed using either the \ac{IP} or \ac{NP} methods. As in the pure $a_1^\text{3pr}-a_1^\text{3pr}$ \ac{PV} method, the $\tau$ flight direction is approximated by the line connecting the \ac{SV} and \ac{PV}. To determine the full $\tau$ four-momentum, the magnitude of the momentum is inferred using a kinematic fit. In this analysis, the \textsc{FastMTT} algorithm~\cite{Bianchini:2014vza} is employed with the constraint that the ditau invariant mass is compatible with $m_H$. The resulting four-vector is constructed under the assumption of the nominal $\tau$ mass, and truncated as necessary to respect the maximum Gottfried–Jackson angle. The \ac{PV} of the $a_1(3\pi)$ is then calculated as described in Section~\ref{Section:Chapter7_PV_Method}.

The acoplanarity angle $\phi_{CP}$ is subsequently reconstructed by combining the \ac{PV} on the $a_1^{3\text{pr}}$ leg with the decay plane from the other $\tau$ leg (either \ac{IP}- or \ac{NP}-based). The same $y_\rho$ sign correction introduced for the first combined method is applied here to resolve the sign ambiguity when one of the decay planes is reconstructed via the \ac{NP} method. The reconstructed $\phi_{CP}$ distributions obtained with the combined \ac{IP}/\ac{NP}--\ac{PV} method are shown in Fig.~\ref{Figure:CPDist_Combined_IPNP_PV}.

\subsection{Summary of reconstruction strategy}
\label{Section:Chapter7_MethodSummary}

For each $\tauh\tauh$ DM topology, the acoplanarity angle $\phi_{CP}$ is reconstructed with the method that maximises CP sensitivity. The mapping used in this analysis is summarised in Table~\ref{Table:Chapter7_ReconstructionMethodSummary}.

\label{Table:Chapter7_ReconstructionMethodSummary}
\end{table}

As can be seen in Table~\ref{Table:Chapter7_ReconstructionMethodSummary}, for decay channels involving one $a_1^{3\mathrm{pr}}$ resonance (i.e.\ $X$–$a_1^{3\mathrm{pr}}$ combinations), the reconstruction strategy differs from that used in the earlier Run 2 analysis~\cite{HiggsCP_CMS_2021}. In the previous approach, the $a_1$ leg was reconstructed with a modified version of the \ac{NP} method. In the present analysis, this has been superseded by the use of the \ac{PV} method, as described in Section~\ref{Section:Chapter7_CombinedMethods}. A direct comparison between the two reconstruction strategies for the $X$–$a_1^{3\mathrm{pr}}$ channels is provided in Fig.~\ref{Figure:Chapter7_X-a1-Improvement}, using Run 3 signal samples. This setup ensures that the observed differences isolate the gain from the updated reconstruction method itself, disentangled from other improvements to the analysis chain that were summarised in the Section~\ref{Section:Chapter7_Introduction}.

\section{Event selection strategy}

This analysis targets the process $\PH \to \tau\tau$ in the fully hadronic final state ($\tauh\tauh$), which corresponds to the largest branching fraction of all ditau topologies ($\sim$42\%). The decay-mode combinations considered are those listed in Table~\ref{Table:Chapter7_ReconstructionMethodSummary}. In this section, the trigger requirements, offline object selections, and event-level selections are described.

\subsection{Triggering}
Events are selected online using two complementary triggers: a dedicated double-$\tau_h$ trigger and a double-$\tau_h$+jet trigger. The corresponding online $p_\text{T}$ thresholds are summarised in Table~\ref{Table:Chapter7_Triggers_TauhTauh}.

\begin{table}[!htbp]

\hline

\end{tabular}
\caption{Table of the minimum online $p_\text{T}$ thresholds for the triggers used in the analysis.}
\label{Table:Chapter7_Triggers_TauhTauh}
\end{table}

The double-$\tau_h$ trigger provides the baseline selection, while the additional double-$\tau_h$+jet path extends acceptance to events with lower-$p_\text{T}$ $\tau_h$ candidates and enhances sensitivity in jet-rich topologies such as \ac{VBF}. Although the two triggers could in principle be used in an orthogonal way, restricting the double-$\tau_h$+jet trigger to its specific phase space, the analysis instead employs their logical OR. This choice increases the complexity of determining trigger efficiency, as overlaps must be carefully handled. However, it delivers a considerable gain in overall performance and ensures that no signal events are lost in the transition region between the two triggers. 

\subsection{Offline object and event-level selections}

The offline object selections closely follow those employed in the four-tau analysis described in Section~\ref{Section:Chapter6_ObjectSelection}, and are summarised in Table~\ref{Table:Chapter7_Tauh_SelectionSummary}. Similarly, to maintain consistency between trigger- and offline-level definitions, selected $\tau_h$ candidates are required to match the corresponding trigger objects within a cone of $\Delta R < 0.5$, with offline $p_\text{T}$ thresholds set 5\GeV higher than the online turn-on values. At the event level, at least two hadronic tau candidates are required, with the leading pair chosen to form the $\tauh\tauh$ system. The pair must carry opposite charge and be separated by $\Delta R > 0.5$. Events containing additional isolated electrons or muons are vetoed ($n_e = 0$, $n_\mu = 0$) to ensure orthogonality with leptonic channels.

\end{table}
}

Referring back to Section~\ref{Section:Chapter7_PhiCP_Reconstruction}, the sensitivity of this analysis is highly dependent on the accurate classification of the $\tau$ \acp{DM}. In the previous iteration of this analysis, a dedicated \ac{MVA} was developed to improve upon the performance of the \ac{HPS} \ac{DM} classification (see Fig.~\ref{Figure:Chapter4_HPS_ConfusionMatrix}). For Run 3, this has been superseded by the use of \textsc{ParticleNet}~\cite{Qu:2019gqs}, which provides substantially improved classification performance and is therefore adopted throughout this analysis.  

In addition to the baseline object and event-level requirements, further refinements are introduced to enhance the CP sensitivity in specific channels. In \acp{DM} relying on the \ac{IP} method, events with tracks of small \ac{IP} relative to their resolution yield reduced discriminating power. To mitigate this, a requirement is imposed on the impact parameter significance in the transverse plane, IP$_\text{sig}$, thereby selecting events where the \ac{IP}-based reconstruction is most effective. Similarly, in channels reconstructed with the \ac{NP} method, events with large values of 
$|y_\rho^+ y_\rho^-|$ provide stronger CP sensitivity\footnote{The observable $y_\rho^\pm$ act as spin-analyser functions: values close to $\pm 1$ correspond to kinematic configurations where the $\tau$ spin information is maximally transferred to the visible $\pi^\pm\pi^0$ system}. Hence, the observable $|y_\rho|$ is exploited to preferentially select such events. These refined selections used for each \ac{DM} are summarised in Table~\ref{Table:Chapter7_RefinedSelections_perDM}.

\section{Object and event corrections}

This section summarises the object- and event-level corrections applied to simulated samples in the $\tauh\tauh$ analysis. 
A few of these follow closely the procedures described for the four-tau analysis in Section~\ref{Section:Chapter6_Corrections}. In particular, the following corrections are applied consistently:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Pileup reweighting (Section~\ref{Section:Chapter6_PU})
    \item Hadronic tau misidentification rates (Section~\ref{Section:Chapter6_Lepton_MisID_SF})
\end{itemize}

However, not all corrections from Section~\ref{Section:Chapter6_Corrections} are directly transferable to this analysis. Certain ingredients must be re-derived or adapted due to the specific selections employed here. In particular, the hadronic tau identification, energy scale, and trigger efficiencies had to be re-derived due to the use of ParticleNet for \ac{DM} classification instead of the \ac{HPS} algorithm, and the optimised \ac{DM}–dependent selections summarised in Table~\ref{Table:Chapter7_RefinedSelections_perDM}. Despite this, the procedures for deriving these corrections remain unchanged from those described in Sections~\ref{Section:Chapter6_Tau_ID_ES}--\ref{Section:Chapter6_HadronicTauTrigger_Efficiencies}. The only distinction is that in this analysis, the corrections are determined in bins of ParticleNet \ac{DM} and applied to $\tauh$ candidates passing the optimised, \ac{DM}-dependent selections.

Other corrections that differ from those used in the four-tau analysis will be discussed in more detail in the remainder of this section. 

\subsection{\texorpdfstring{$\PZ \, \, p_\text{T}$-mass reweighting}{Z pT-mass reweighting}}

\ac{DY} events generated at \ac{LO} using $\MADGRAPH$ do not accurately describe the kinematic regime in which the $\PZ/\gamma^*$ boson has high transverse momentum ($p_\text{T}$) or large invariant mass. This limitation is particularly relevant for extended Higgs sector searches, which are sensitive to such mismodelling due to the tight $p_\text{T}$ cuts imposed on the visible $\PGt$ decay products. These cuts preferentially select events in which the $\PZ/\gamma^*$ boson is boosted. Although \ac{NLO} \ac{DY} samples provide an improved description of the high-$p_\text{T}$ boson spectrum, residual mismodelling may still persist. To prevent such distortions from impacting analysis observables, a dedicated reweighting procedure is applied.

The $\PZ \, \, p_\text{T}$-mass reweighting is derived from a control region enriched in $Z/\gamma^* \to \mu\mu$ events. Events are selected by requiring a pair of oppositely charged muons, separated by $\Delta R > 0.5$, that satisfy the baseline selection criteria summarised in Table~\ref{Table:Chapter6_ObjectSelectionSummary}. Additionally, the leading muon must pass the single muon trigger at both the online and offline reconstruction levels. This condition ensures that the selected events reflect the same trigger efficiency conditions as those applied in the main analysis, thereby avoiding potential biases in the reconstructed dimuon $p_\text{T}$ distribution.

The $\PZ \, \, p_\text{T}$-mass reweighting is derived from a control region enriched in $Z/\gamma^*\to\mu\mu$ events. Events are selected by requiringc two oppositely charged muons with a separation $\Delta R > 0.5$. The set of selection requirements is listed in Table~\ref{Table:Chapter6_ObjectSelectionSummary}, including the condition that the leading muon must pass the single-muon trigger, both at the online and offline levels. This ensures consistency with the trigger requirements used in the analysis and suppresses potential biases in the $p_\text{T}$ spectrum.

The reweighting factors are measured in a two-dimensional histogram of the dimuon transverse momentum ($p_\text{T}^{\ell\ell}$) and invariant mass ($m_{\ell\ell}$). In each bin of this histogram, the weight is computed as:

\begin{equation_pad}
    w(p_\text{T}^{\ell\ell},m_{\ell\ell}) = \frac{N_\text{data}(p_\text{T}^{\ell\ell},m_{\ell\ell}) - N_\text{MC}^\text{non-DY}(p_\text{T}^{\ell\ell},m_{\ell\ell})}{N_\text{MC}^\text{DY}(p_\text{T}^{\ell\ell},m_{\ell\ell})}
\end{equation_pad}

where $N_\text{data}$ is the observed yield in data,  $N_\text{MC}^\text{non-DY}$ is the estimated contribution from non-\ac{DY} backgrounds and $N^\text{DY}\text{MC}$ is the yield from the simulated \ac{DY} samples.

To preserve the overall \ac{DY} normalisation, the weights are normalised such that the sum of all the weights across the entire  $p_\text{T}$-mass plane equals unity. This constraint ensures that the application of the weights does not artificially rescale the total \ac{DY} cross-section, but only corrects the shape of the kinematic phase space. Another important aspect of the reweighting approach is that the correction is applied at the generator level, using the true $Z/\gamma^*$ boson $p_\text{T}$ and invariant mass. Hence, the method relies on the assumption that the reconstructed dimuon kinematics are closely matched to their generated-level counterparts.

The performance of the reweighting procedure is illustrated in Figure~\ref{Figure:Chapter6_ZPT_Reweighting}, which shows the distributions of the reconstructed dimuon $p_\text{T}$ and mass before and after reweighting. In the context of the dimuon channel, these observables are also referred to as the visible transverse momentum ($p_\text{T}^\text{vis}$) and visible mass ($m_\text{vis}$) of the dilepton system. The method exhibits good closure in $Z/\gamma^* \to \mu\mu$ events, validating the assumption of reconstructed–generator level agreement. Additional cross-checks using $Z/\gamma^* \to ee$ events provide orthogonal validation; however, their effectiveness is limited by the comparatively poorer resolution of the \ac{CMS} \ac{ECAL}. A representative closure test in the $ee$ channel is shown in Figure~\ref{Figure:Chapter6_ZPT_Reweighting_ee}.

\subsection{Top-quark \texorpdfstring{p$_\text{T}$}{pT} reweighting}

The kinematic distributions of $\ttbar$ events are mismodelled in simulation. To improve the disagreement between data and simulation, dedicated weights are applied to the top-quark $p_\text{T}$ distribution. These weights are given by,

\begin{equation}
    w = \sqrt{\text{SF}(p_T^{t}) \cdot \text{SF}(p_T^{\bar{t}})}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
    \text{SF}(p_\text{T}) = a \cdot e^{-b\cdot p_\text{T}} - c  \cdot p_\text{T} + d
\end{equation}

where the coefficients were measured using Run 2 data and found to be a = 0.103, b = 0.0118, c = 0.000134 and d = 0.973~\cite{Czakon:2017wor}.

This weight was originally derived at $\sqrt{s} = 13\TeV$, hence an extrapolation is required to account for the higher collision energy of $13.6\TeV$ used in Run 3. This is achieved by fitting the ratio of generator-level top-quark $p_\text{T}$ spectra between 13 and 13.6$\TeV$, resulting in an additional multiplicative correction factor,

\begin{equation}
    \text{SF}(p_\text{T}) = 0.991 + 0.000075 \, p_\text{T}
\end{equation}

\subsection{IP Calibration}

As discussed in Section~\ref{Section:Chapter7_IP_METHOD}, the \ac{IP} vector is a key ingredient in reconstructing the $\PGt$ decay plane and, consequently, the CP-sensitive acoplanarity angle $\phi_{CP}$. Accurate modelling of the IP vector in simulation is therefore essential. Since the \ac{IP} vector is not perfectly described in simulation, a dedicated calibration is performed using clean samples of $Z \to \mu\mu$ and $Z \to ee$ events. 

To correct discrepancies between data and simulation in the Cartesian components of the \ac{IP} vector, the quantile mapping method is employed. In this approach, the cumulative distribution of the uncalibrated simulation is mapped to that of the data, so that the corrected coordinate of the \ac{IP} vector is given by
\begin{equation}
\mathrm{IP}_i^{\mathrm{corr}} = F^{-1}_{\mathrm{Data}}\!\left( F_{\mathrm{MC}}(\mathrm{IP}_i) \right)
\label{Equation:Chapter7_IP_Corr_1}
\end{equation}
where $\mathrm{IP}_i^{\mathrm{corr}}$ and $\mathrm{IP}_i$ denote the corrected and uncorrected components of the IP vector, $F_{\mathrm{MC}}$ is the \ac{CDF} in simulation, and $F^{-1}_{\mathrm{data}}$ is the quantile function (inverse \ac{CDF}) in data. The procedure is illustrated schematically in Fig.~\ref{Figure:IP_QuantileMapping}.

\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{Figures/Chapter7/quantile_mapping.pdf}
    \caption{Schematic representation of the quantile mapping procedure.}
    \label{Figure:IP_QuantileMapping}
\end{figure}

Given the dependence of the IP resolution on track $\eta$, the correction is performed in bins of $|\eta|$ for both $Z \to \mu\mu$ and $Z \to ee$ events. An additional subtlety arises in the treatment of non-prompt particles. Equation~\ref{Equation:Chapter7_IP_Corr_1} is designed for prompt tracks, where the true \ac{IP} at the generator level vanishes. Applying the same correction to non-prompt particles ($\eg$ those from $\PGt$ decays) would incorrectly distort their genuine decay length. To avoid this, the calibration is instead applied to the residual between the reconstructed and generator-level IP vectors:

\begin{equation}
\mathrm{IP}_i^{\mathrm{corr}} = \mathrm{IP}_i^{\mathrm{gen}} + F^{-1}{\mathrm{Data}}\left( F_{\mathrm{MC}}\big(\mathrm{IP}_i - \mathrm{IP}_i^{\mathrm{gen}}\big) \right)
\end{equation}

where $\mathrm{IP}_i^{\mathrm{gen}}$ is the generator-level component of the \ac{IP} vector.
This procedure ensures that the correction accounts for detector effects without biasing the genuine lifetime signatures of non-prompt particles. For prompt tracks, where $\mathrm{IP}_i^{\mathrm{gen}}=0$, the formula naturally reduces to the simpler form of Eq.~\ref{Equation:Chapter7_IP_Corr_1}. 

The effectiveness of the correction procedure is demonstrated in Fig.~\ref{Figure:IPvector_Corrections} which compare the agreement between data and simulation before and after applying the \ac{IP} calibration.

The impact of the \ac{IP} vector calibration on the discriminating power of the acoplanarity angle observable is illustrated in Fig.~\ref{Figure:Chapter7_IPCalibration_Impact}. A slight reduction in the asymmetry between the CP-even and CP-odd scenarios is observed after applying the corrections. This behaviour indicates that, prior to calibration, the simulation slightly overestimated the resolution of the \ac{IP} vector.

\subsection{\texorpdfstring{$\vec{E}^{\text{miss}}_\text{T}$}{ET miss} recoil}

To ensure the accurate modelling of ($\vec{E}_T^\text{miss}$), recoil corrections are applied to some of the simulated samples. A source of this mismodelling comes from the hadronic recoil, defined as

\begin{equation}
    \vec{U}_\text{T} =  \vec{E}_T^\text{miss} - \sum_\nu p_\text{T}^\nu
\end{equation}

where the sum runs over all neutrinos ($\nu$) in the event. The hadronic recoil is determined using a sample of $\PZ \to \mu\mu$ events by measuring the $p_\text{T}$ of the Z boson and the total transverse momentum of the recoiling jets, $\vec{H}_\text{T}$. In this case, no neutrinos are present, so the hadronic recoil is identical to the reconstructed $\vec{E}_T^\text{miss}$, and can be expressed as

\begin{equation}
    \vec{U}_\text{T} = -\vec{H}_T - p_\text{T}^\PZ \equiv \vec{E}_T^\text{miss}
\end{equation}

The recoil vector is then decomposed into components parallel and perpendicular to the $\PZ$ boson direction in the transverse plane. Distributions of $U_\parallel$ and $U_\perp$ are constructed in bins of $p_T^\PZ$ and jet multiplicity, both in data and simulation. From these histograms, the corresponding \acp{CDF} are derived.

\begin{equation}
F_\text{Data/MC}(U_{\parallel/\perp}) = \int_{-\infty}^{U_{\parallel/\perp}} f_\text{Data/MC}(x) \,\, dx
\end{equation}

A simulated recoil value $U$ is then corrected by quantile mapping:

\begin{equation}
U_{\parallel/\perp}^\prime = F_\text{data}^{-1}\big(F_\text{MC}(U)\big)
\end{equation}

This procedure maps the simulated recoil distribution onto that observed in data. The corrected parallel and perpendicular components of the recoil are propagated back into the computation of $\vec{E}_T^\text{miss}$, yielding improved agreement between data and simulation in observables sensitive to $\vec{E}_T^\text{miss}$.


\subsection{ggH quark-mass effects}

To address the limitations of the large-$m_t$ approximation used in gluon-fusion Higgs production, corrections for finite top-quark mass effects are applied. In this approximation, the top-quark loop is replaced by a pointlike interaction, which provides an accurate description of the inclusive cross section but does not capture the correct $m_t$ dependence at high Higgs transverse momentum. For $p_T^H \gtrsim m_t$, the internal loop structure is resolved and the approximation overestimates the cross section. To recover the correct kinematic behaviour, differential reweighting factors are obtained using \textsc{HRes}~\cite{deFlorian:2012mx,Grazzini:2013mca}, which computes the Higgs $p_T$ spectrum both in the large-$m_t$ limit and with exact top-mass dependence. The ratio of these predictions is applied to simulated events to restore the mass dependence in the high-$p_T$ region.

\section{Background modelling}
\label{Section:Chapter7_Background_Modelling}

The backgrounds in the $\tauh\tauh$ channel are grouped into three classes:
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\roman*)]
\item \textbf{Genuine-$\PGt$ backgrounds:} Events containing only genuine $\tau_h$. This class is dominated by $\PZ/\gamma^*\!\to\!\tau\tau$, with additional contributions from $\ttbar$ (via $\PW\!\to\!\tau\nu$) and dibosons. These contributions are estimated using simulation

\item \textbf{Jet$\to\tauh$ misidentification:} Backgrounds with one or more jets are misidentified as $\tau_h$. This class is modelled using a data-driven $F_F$ method.

\item \textbf{Lepton$\to\tauh$ misidentification:} Although, subdominant in $\tauh\tauh$ thanks to dedicated anti-$e/\mu$ discriminators, this class is estimated from simulation.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{\texorpdfstring{Background from Jets Misidentified as $\PGt_h$ (Jet $\to \PGt_h$)}{Background from Jets Misidentified as hadronic taus}}
\label{Section:Chapter7_FF}

As discussed in Section~\ref{Section:Chapter6_JetToTauBackground}, MC simulation does not provide a reliable description of the jet$\to\tauh$ misidentification rate. Therefore, as in the four-tau analysis, a Fake-Factor ($F_F$) method is employed. In this channel, a simplified implementation closer to the Classical Fake Factor approach (Section~\ref{Section:Chapter6_FakeFactors_Classical}) is used, rather than the \ac{ML}-based reweighting strategy of Section~\ref{Section:Chapter6_FakeFactors_BDT}. 

In brief, the method estimates the jet$\to\tauh$ contribution in the \ac{SR} by extrapolating from a sideband region defined through $\tauh$ identification criteria. The raw $F_F$ is computed as the ratio of events passing the nominal ID to those failing it but passing a looser requirement (Equation~\ref{Equation:Chapter6_FF}). The \ac{WP} used to define these regions are summarised in Table~\ref{Table:Chapter7_TauhSelectionSummary}.

Once derived, the $F_F$ is corrected using dedicated closure and extrapolation factors to account for residual mismodelling. These arise both from differences between the signal and determination regions, and from the limited set of variables used to parameterise the misidentification rate. The corrected $F_F$ is then applied to events in the \ac{SR} that fail the nominal ID but pass the alternative ID, yielding an estimate of the jet$\to\tauh$ background. As noted in Section~\ref{Section:Chapter6_FakeFactors_Classical}, the $F_F$ is measured only for the leading $\tauh$ candidate. Consequently, events where the leading $\tauh$ is genuine but the subleading candidate is a misidentified jet are not covered. These subdominant contributions are taken from simulation and added back to the estimate.
